# Xian

Xian is a JavaFX task-management chatbot that helps users create, view, update,
search, and manage tasks.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 25, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first).
1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 25** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
1. Run the application using the `xian.Launcher` class or the Gradle `run` task.
   If the setup is correct, the Xian JavaFX window will open.

**Warning:** Keep the `src\main\java` folder as the root folder for Java files (i.e., don't rename those folders or move Java files to another folder outside of this folder path), as this is the default location some tools (e.g., Gradle) expect to find Java files.
